FindExtrinsicParameter script determines:
1. The matrix RL_R and translation vector r_R.
2. Creates a list of depths computed for all inliers.
3. Shows, in the second image of the pair, the original location of the inliers, and the location of the re-projected points (It uses different colors for these two sets of points).
4. The average squared reprojection error.
